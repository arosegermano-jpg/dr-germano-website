                    <p>
                        As an orthopedic surgeon specializing in hip and knee conditions,
                        Dr. Germano sees patients for arthritis, cartilage wear, meniscus
                        injuries, ligament problems, joint deformity, and pain after
                        previous surgery. He also evaluates patients with hip or knee pain
                        that affects walking, sleep, work, or sports, even if they are not
                        yet candidates for surgery.

                <summary>
                    <span>Do I need a referral, or can I make an appointment directly?</span>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>
                        In many cases, patients can call the office and schedule directly.
                        Some insurance plans, however, require a referral from your primary
                        care physician or another provider. If you are unsure, we recommend
                        contacting your insurance company or calling the office so our team
                        can help you understand what is required.

                    <p>
                        Please bring a photo ID, insurance card, a list of your current
                        medications, and any recent imaging studies (X-rays, MRIs, or CT
                        scans) related to your hip or knee. If you’ve had prior surgery,
                        operative reports or previous records can be very helpful. Wearing
                        loose, comfortable clothing makes it easier to examine the joint.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>
                        Joint replacement is usually considered when arthritis or joint
                        damage causes pain that no longer responds well to medications,
                        injections, physical therapy, or activity modification. If pain
                        limits your ability to walk, climb stairs, sleep, or enjoy the
                        activities you love, it may be time to discuss whether hip or knee
                        replacement is appropriate for you.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>
                        Robotic and computer-assisted techniques use advanced imaging and
                        planning software to help the surgeon position implants with a high
                        degree of accuracy. The robot does <em>not</em> perform the surgery
                        on its own; rather, it is a tool that helps the surgeon execute a
                        precise, patient-specific plan based on your anatomy.

                    <p>
                        Recovery varies from patient to patient. Many people walk with a
                        walker or cane within days of surgery and gradually transition to
                        more normal activities over the following weeks. Most patients make
                        steady progress for three to six months, and the full recovery can
                        continue to improve for up to a year. Your exact timeline depends on
                        your health, activity level, and the type of procedure performed.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>
                        Yes, physical therapy is a key part of recovery for most patients.
                        Early on, therapy focuses on safe walking, swelling control, and
                        gentle motion. As you progress, strengthening and balance exercises
                        help you return to everyday activities. Dr. Germano will provide a
                        specific therapy plan tailored to your surgery and goals.

                    <p>
                        Joint replacement is a very successful procedure for many patients,
                        but like all surgery, it carries risks. These can include infection,
                        blood clots, stiffness, dislocation, leg length differences, nerve
                        or blood vessel injury, and wear or loosening of the implants over
                        time. Before surgery, Dr. Germano will review your personal risk
                        factors and the steps taken to reduce those risks.

                    <span>How long will my hip or knee replacement last?</span>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>
                        Modern joint replacements are designed to be durable. Many implants
                        can last 15–20 years or longer, especially with newer materials and
                        improved techniques. However, longevity depends on factors such as
                        your age, activity level, weight, bone quality, and overall health.
                        Regular follow-up visits allow your surgeon to monitor the implant
                        over time.
