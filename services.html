                    <span class="service-question">What is it?</span>
                    Total hip replacement is a surgical procedure that removes the damaged parts of the hip joint
                    and replaces them with smooth, durable implants. The goal is to relieve pain, restore motion,
                    and allow patients to return to normal daily activities with improved comfort and stability.
                </p>

                <p class="service-text">
                    <span class="service-question">What to expect:</span>
                    Before surgery, you’ll meet with Dr. Germano to review your symptoms, imaging, and overall
                    health. On the day of surgery, the arthritic portions of the ball-and-socket joint are removed
                    and replaced with a metal stem, a ball, and a socket liner designed to move smoothly together.
                    Most patients begin walking with assistance the same day or the morning after surgery and
                    continue recovery with a structured rehabilitation plan.

                    <span class="service-question">Benefits of surgery:</span>
                    For many patients, hip replacement significantly reduces or eliminates joint pain, improves
                    walking and mobility, and allows a return to activities that were limited by arthritis. Modern
                    implant designs and surgical techniques are focused on long-term durability and a more natural
                    feeling hip.

                    <span class="service-question">What is it?</span>
                    Total knee replacement is a procedure that resurfaces the worn ends of the thigh bone, shin
                    bone, and sometimes the kneecap with smooth, contoured implants. These components are designed
                    to glide together comfortably, reducing pain and improving knee function.

                    <span class="service-question">What to expect:</span>
                    During surgery, the damaged cartilage and a thin layer of bone are carefully shaped and replaced
                    with metal and plastic components that match your anatomy. After surgery, most patients begin
                    standing and walking with assistance soon after arriving in the recovery area. A focused physical
                    therapy program helps restore strength, motion, and confidence in the new joint over the weeks
                    that follow.

                    <span class="service-question">What is it?</span>
                    Partial knee replacement is a procedure that treats arthritis limited to one area of the knee,
                    most often the inner (medial) compartment. Instead of resurfacing the entire joint, only the
                    damaged portion is replaced with a small implant, preserving healthy bone, cartilage, and
                    ligaments.
                </p>

                <p class="service-text">
                    <span class="service-question">What to expect:</span>
                    During surgery, the worn surfaces in the affected compartment are carefully removed and
                    replaced with a contoured metal and plastic implant. The remainder of the knee is left intact.
                    Many patients go home the same day or after a short stay and begin walking with assistance
                    shortly after surgery. Physical therapy focuses on restoring motion, strength, and a smooth,
                    natural gait.

                    <span class="service-question">Benefits of surgery:</span>
                    Because only part of the knee is replaced, patients often experience a smaller incision, less
                    discomfort in the early recovery period, and a knee that can feel more “natural” compared with
                    a full replacement. Many patients return more quickly to daily activities and low-impact
                    exercise.

                    <span class="service-question">What is it?</span>
                    Revision surgery is a specialized procedure performed when a previous hip or knee replacement
                    is no longer functioning as it should. The operation may involve removing and replacing worn,
                    loose, or damaged components, addressing bone loss, or correcting instability around the joint.
                </p>

                <p class="service-text">
                    <span class="service-question">What to expect:</span>
                    Revision procedures are often more complex than first-time joint replacements and require
                    careful planning. Before surgery, Dr. Germano reviews prior records, X-rays, and advanced
                    imaging to understand why the joint is failing. During surgery, old components and scar tissue
                    are removed, the bone is carefully reconstructed when needed, and new implants are placed to
                    restore alignment and stability. Recovery may be slower than with an initial replacement, and a
                    structured rehabilitation program is important.

                    Robotic-assisted surgery uses advanced 3D imaging and computer guidance to help plan and
                    perform hip and knee replacements with a high degree of precision. The robot does not replace
                    the surgeon; instead, it provides real-time feedback and helps fine-tune implant positioning
                    based on each patient’s anatomy.

                    <span class="service-question">What to expect:</span>
                    Before surgery, detailed imaging is used to create a virtual model of your joint and plan the
                    ideal size and placement of the implants. In the operating room, Dr. Germano uses robotic
                    guidance to prepare the bone and position the components according to this plan, making
                    adjustments as needed based on how the joint moves during surgery. Recovery follows the same
                    general pattern as a traditional replacement but may benefit from more precise alignment and
                    soft-tissue balance.

                    <span class="service-question">What is it?</span>
                    Hip arthroscopy is a minimally invasive procedure performed through small incisions using a
                    camera and specialized instruments. It is used to treat certain conditions inside the hip joint,
                    such as labral tears, femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), and areas of cartilage damage.
                </p>

                <p class="service-text">
                    <span class="service-question">What to expect:</span>
                    During surgery, a small camera is inserted into the hip joint to allow a clear view of the
                    cartilage, labrum, and bone surfaces. Through separate small incisions, instruments are used to
                    repair or remove damaged tissue and to gently reshape areas of bone that are causing impingement.
                    Most patients go home the same day. Crutches are often used for a short period, followed by
                    guided physical therapy to restore motion and strength.

                <p class="service-text">
                    <span class="service-question">Benefits of surgery:</span>
                    For appropriately selected patients, hip arthroscopy can reduce pain, improve hip motion, and
                    may help delay or prevent progression of damage in the joint. The smaller incisions and
                    minimally invasive approach typically allow for a quicker early recovery compared with open
                    surgery.

                <p class="service-text">
                    <span class="service-question">What is it?</span>
                    Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and other biological injections use components from your own blood
                    or specialized injectable medications to help reduce inflammation and support the body’s natural
                    healing response. These treatments may be used for certain tendon problems or early joint
                    arthritis when surgery is not yet needed.
                </p>

                <p class="service-text">
                    <span class="service-question">What to expect:</span>
                    For PRP, a small amount of blood is drawn from your arm and processed to concentrate the
                    platelets. The PRP is then carefully injected into the targeted area, often using imaging
                    guidance for accuracy. After the injection, mild soreness is common for a short period, and
                    activity is gradually increased as tolerated. Other types of injections, such as cortisone or
                    hyaluronic acid (“gel” injections), may also be recommended based on your specific condition.
                </p>

                <p class="service-text">
                    <span class="service-question">Benefits of treatment:</span>
                    Injections can help decrease pain, improve function, and delay the need for surgery in some
                    patients. They are typically performed in an office or procedure setting and do not require
                    anesthesia or an overnight stay.
